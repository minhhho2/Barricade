## Barricade
Barricade is a top down 1 player survival iOS game. After an exhaustive search online and being unable to find a PC game that occupied the majority of my day as a kid, I decided to jump into iOS development and learn swift by building a mobile app based on the game 'Pluto'.
Top down 1 player iOS game. 

## Description
The player starts on the bottom left corner and moves up, down, left, or right by tapping on that area of the screen.
The player proceeds to the next round when they 'barricade' the foe. This is achieved by completely surrounding the foe with objects on the screen.
